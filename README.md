# Bugs
When i added  the Headers background's image, and check it, i discovered that there was no the image.
I figured out that the image link was not correctly connecting to my CSS file and that was because i was forgetting to use the double dot which indicates the relative file path.
background-image : url(../img/apple-or-donut.jpg);
