# Bugs
When I added the Header background image and checked it, I discovered that there was no image.
I figured out that the image link was not correctly connecting to my CSS file, and that was because I forgot to use the double dot, which indicates the relative file path.
background-image : url(../img/apple-or-donut.jpg);
